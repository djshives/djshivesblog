By using the lm() function, building complex linear models is a quick and efficient affair.\nData and Exploratory Data Analysis Let\u0026rsquo;s begin by loading in the necessary packages\u0026hellip;\nlibrary(MASS) library(tidyverse) library(ggrepel) library(extraDistr) library(loo) library(bridgesampling) library(brms) library(rstan) library(bayesplot) library(tictoc) library(hypr) library(tidybayes) rstan_options(auto_write = FALSE) options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) select \u0026lt;- dplyr::select  \u0026hellip;And create a toy dataset. For this lab, we will be using the research design by Hulme et al. (1984) that investigates whether age and speech rate are involed with memory ability.\ndata \u0026lt;- tibble(age = c(4,4,7,7,10,10), speech_rate = c(1,2,2,4,3,6), memory = c(14,23,30,50,39,67), id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) data  ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## age speech_rate memory id ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 4 1 14 1 ## 2 4 2 23 2 ## 3 7 2 30 3 ## 4 7 4 50 4 ## 5 10 3 39 5 ## 6 10 6 67 6  As we can see from the above as speech rate increases, so does memory ability. The same, however, can be said for age and memory ability. This can be better illustrated visually.\ndata %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = speech_rate, y = memory, group = age)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~age) + geom_label_repel(aes(label = memory), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE) + scale_x_continuous( limits = c(0, 7), sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . , name = \u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;, breaks = NULL, labels = NULL) ) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Memory by Speech Rate\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  Unfortunately, it looks like we have an issue of independent variables being correlated with one another, known as multicollinearity.\ncor(data)  ## age speech_rate memory id ## age 1.0000000 0.7500000 0.8027961 0.9561829 ## speech_rate 0.7500000 1.0000000 0.9889517 0.8964215 ## memory 0.8027961 0.9889517 1.0000000 0.9261501 ## id 0.9561829 0.8964215 0.9261501 1.0000000  As we can see from the above, there is a 75% correlation between age and speech_rate. This means that a complete pooling regression model, where all of the data is pooled together, is not appropriate.\nWe can build the complete pooling model using the lm() function. The dependent variable, memory, is placed to the left of the \u0026ldquo;~\u0026rdquo; in the function, and the independent variables, age and speech_rate, to the right. The \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; parameter is filled by data.\nThe summary() function is then used to view the regression output.\ncomplete_pool \u0026lt;- lm( memory ~ 1 + speech_rate + age, data = data ) summary(complete_pool)  ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = memory ~ 1 + speech_rate + age, data = data) ## ## Residuals: ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## -1.167 -1.667 2.333 3.333 -1.167 -1.667 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In large data sets, this can become especially confusing and time consuming.\nPartial-Pooling Model: Multilevel Rather than no pooling or complete pooling, we can create a partially-pooled multilevel model! Partial pooling is a process where population-level and individual-level effects are estimated simultaneously. By doing so, each individual\u0026rsquo;s estimated effect is a reflection of the weighted combination of their own data and the population average. This allows us to account for the relationship between speech rate and age.\nUsing the brms package, we can easily fit a multilevel model in a very similar fashion to the lm() function. The dependent variable for the model again falls to the left of the \u0026ldquo;~\u0026rdquo; and the independent variables are placed to the right. What is different, however, is in the parentheses, \u0026ldquo;(speech_rate|age)\u0026rdquo;. What this parameter does is specify that we want varying slopes and intercepts for speech rate for each age grouping.\n(Aside: we also specify several other things unique to Bayesian models, most notably priors. Prior specification is a topic in it of itself, and for this model we can use vaguely informative priors based on the means and standard deviations of the data itself.)\npriors \u0026lt;- c( prior(normal(3, 2), class = b, coef = speech_rate), prior(normal(0, 2), class = Intercept), prior(normal(0, 2), class = sigma), prior(normal(0, 2), class = sd, coef = Intercept, group = age), prior(normal(3, 2), class = sd, coef = speech_rate, group = age) ) partial_pool_model \u0026lt;- brm( memory ~ 1 + speech_rate + (speech_rate|age), data = data, prior= priors, iter = 4000, control = list( adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 20 ) )  Similar to using the \u0026ldquo;summary()\u0026rdquo; function for the complete pooling model, we can use it here for the multilevel model.\nsummary(partial_pool_model)  ## Warning: There were 278 divergent transitions after warmup.

You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-523978146', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

By wrapping a paragraph in {{% callout note %}} ... {{% /callout %}}, it will render as an aside.\n{{% callout note %}} A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers. {{% /callout %}}  renders as\n A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.   Spoilers Add a spoiler to a page to reveal text, such as an answer to a question, after a button is clicked.\n{{\u0026lt; spoiler text=\u0026quot;Click to view the spoiler\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} You found me! {{\u0026lt; /spoiler \u0026gt;}}  renders as\nClick to view the spoiler You found me!\n Icons Academic enables you to use a wide range of icons from Font Awesome and Academicons in addition to emojis.\nHere are some examples using the icon shortcode to render icons:\n{{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;terminal\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fas\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Terminal {{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;python\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fab\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Python {{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;r-project\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fab\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} R  renders as\n  Terminal\n Python\n R\nDid you find this page helpful?
