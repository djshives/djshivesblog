<h2>(1) Section 12.3.3 from your textbook refers to: The problem with replications of a meaningless experiment: ‘alpha and the captain’s age’. The issue here is that if you run an ineffectual experiment enough times you can always find a significant result by chance. The textbook mentions that if you repeat an experiment 20 times, you are guaranteed to find a significant result with .64 probability, and the probability is .92 if you repeat the experiment 50 times.</h2>

<h2>(3) Now assume that the published result reflects a true effect. Specifically, let’s imagine the study had two groups (between-subjects), with 20 subjects in each group.
